### Who Am I?
I’m a first-year Computer Science student with a keen interest in data analysis, PHP development, and problem-solving. While I’m still learning programming and backend development, I actively build projects to practice debugging, data cleaning, visualization, and analytical thinking.

I’m passionate about startups, digital products, and real-world problem solving, and I believe the best way to learn software engineering is by building, experimenting, and continuously improving. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, analyzing them from multiple angles, and designing efficient, maintainable, and scalable solutions.

My journey in technology began with curiosity and a desire to understand how systems work. Every project I take on is an opportunity to learn, improve, and strengthen my technical and analytical skills, while enhancing my collaboration and problem-solving abilities. I aim to grow into a proficient developer who can contribute to impactful digital products and innovative solutions.
