# Hi, I'm Md. Tanjil Islam Shuvo 👋

### About Me
I’m a first-year Computer Science student with a keen interest in PHP development, debugging, and problem-solving. Though I’m new to programming, I am eager to learn, experiment, and grow by building real-world projects and tackling coding challenges.
My journey in technology began with curiosity and a desire to understand how things work. I am passionate about analyzing problems, finding efficient solutions, and writing clean, maintainable code. Currently, I am exploring PHP, web development fundamentals, and data-driven problem solving, while developing the skills needed to become a proficient backend developer.

I believe in learning by doing, and I’m committed to continuously improving my coding, analytical thinking, and debugging abilities through hands-on projects and collaborative work.
